# KMeans

This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to compress an image.

To run the project, run the file ex7.m in Octave or Matlab.

The code is written in Matlab but can be run in Octave as well.

The image can be changed in the file ex7.m and new image can be used to test the working of the algorithm

Piece of advice: Do not use a big files (>35kB) for clustering as it will take a pretty long time to complete.
